Just a collection of assignments and mini-projects completed as part of different classes: intro to machine learning, deep learning, and nanoelectronics & biotechnology.

These projects focus on neural networks, graph learning, transformers, and data representations.

xor.py
Shows how a small neural network can represent the XOR function and visualizes the output.

mnist_autoencoder.py
Trains an autoencoder to compress and reconstruct handwritten digit images.

67960_CIFAR10.ipynb
Trains a convolutional neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

pca_tsne_umap_practice.ipynb
Visualizes high-dimensional data using PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP.

forecasting_transformer.py
Uses a small Transformer to predict future values in a time series.

text_classification_transformer.py
Trains a Transformer-based model to classify text documents.

sentence_transformer.py
Generates sentence embeddings and performs semantic search over text.

cora_node_classification.py
Uses a graph neural network to classify nodes in the Cora citation graph.
